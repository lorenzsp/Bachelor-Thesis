	abstract = {These lectures aim at providing an introduction to the properties of gravitational waves and in particular to those gravitational waves that are expected as a consequence of perturbations of black holes and neutron stars. Imprinted in the gravitational radiation emitted by these objects is, in fact, a wealth of physical information. In the case of black holes, a detailed knowledge of the gravitational radiation emitted as a response to perturbations will reveal us important details about their mass and spin, but also about the fundamental properties of the event horizon. In the case of neutron stars, on the other hand, this information can provide a detailed map of their internal structure and tell us about the equation of state of matter at very high density, thus filling-in a gap in energies and densities that cannot be investigated by experiments in terrestrial laboratories.},

	abstract = {We present three-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of binary neutron star ({BNS}) mergers from the late stage of the inspiral process up to \${\textbackslash}sim 20\$ ms after the system has merged, either to form a hyper-massive neutron star ({NS}) or a rotating black hole ({BH}). We investigate five equal-mass models of total gravitational mass \$2.207\$, \$2.373\$, \$2.537\$, \$2.697\$ and \$2.854 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, respectively, and four unequal mass models with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{ADM}\}\}{\textbackslash}simeq 2.53{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$q{\textbackslash}simeq 0.94\$, \$0.88\$, \$0.82\$, and \$0.77\$ (where \$q = M{\textasciicircum}\{(1)\}/M{\textasciicircum}\{(2)\}\$ is the mass ratio). We use a semi-realistic equation of state ({EOS}) namely, the seven-segment piece-wise polytropic {SLyPP} with a thermal component given by \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{th\} = 1.8\$. We have also compared the resulting dynamics (for one model) using both, the {BSSN}-{NOK} and {CCZ}4 methods for the evolution of the gravitational sector, and also different reconstruction methods for the matter sector, namely {PPM}, {WENO} and {MP}5. Our results show agreement and high resolution, but superiority of {BSSN}-{NOK} supplemented by {WENO} reconstruction at lower resolutions. One of the important characteristics of the present investigation is that, for the first time, this has been done using only publicly available open source software, in particular, the Einstein Toolkit code deployed for the dynamical evolution and the {LORENE} code for the generation of the initial models. All of the source code and parameters used for the simulations have been made publicly available. This not only makes it possible to re-run and re-analyze our data; it also enables others to directly build upon this work for future research.},

	abstract = {The recent detections of gravitational waves by the advanced {LIGO} and Virgo detectors open up new tests of modified gravity theories in the strong-field and dynamical, extreme gravity regime. Such tests rely sensitively on the phase evolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the energy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four different methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the action under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field equations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy complex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem in field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-{\textbackslash}{AE}\{\}ther theory to find the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which energy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy tensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-{\textbackslash}{AE}\{\}ther theory are presented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate of energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally different. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor that is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante procedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz invariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-{\textbackslash}{AE}\{\}ther theory. The methods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of predictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with observations.},

Like most other pulsars, its rotational behavior over such long time scales is significantly affected by small-scale irregularities not explicitly accounted for in a deterministic model. Nevertheless, the physically important astrometric, spin, and orbital parameters are well determined and well decoupled from the timing noise. We have determined a significant result for proper motion, \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} = -1.43{\textbackslash}pm0.13\$, \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}delta\}=-0.70{\textbackslash}pm0.13\$ mas yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The pulsar exhibited a small timing glitch in May 2003, with \$\{{\textbackslash}Delta f\}/f=3.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$, and a smaller timing peculiarity in mid-1992. A relativistic solution for orbital parameters yields improved mass estimates for the pulsar and its companion, \$m\_1=1.4398{\textbackslash}pm0.0002 {\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$ and \$m\_2=1.3886{\textbackslash}pm0.0002 {\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$. The system's orbital period has been decreasing at a rate \$0.997{\textbackslash}pm0.002\$ times that predicted as a result of gravitational radiation damping in general relativity. As we have shown before, this result provides conclusive evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation as predicted by Einstein's theory.},

Together with the Keplerian orbital parameters, measurements of the relativistic periastron advance and a combination of gravitational redshift and time dilation yield the stellar masses with high accuracy. The measured rate of change of orbital period agrees with that expected from the emission of gravitational radiation, according to general relativity, to within about 0.2 percent. Systematic effects depending on the pulsar distance and on poorly known galactic constants now dominate the error budget, so tighter bounds will be difficult to obtain. Geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis leads to secular changes in pulse shape as the pulsar-observer geometry changes. This effect makes it possible to model the two-dimensional structure of the beam. We find that the beam is elongated in the latitude direction and appears to be pinched in longitude near its center.},

His general theory of relativity further taught us that spacetime is not just a stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: The field equation of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime. Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for other science. One aspect of dynamical spacetime -- its radiative character, ``gravitational radiation'' -- will inaugurate entirely new techniques for observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next one hundred years, much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit spacetime as a tool for astronomy.

From our results, we propose as a conjecture that if the turning point of binding energy (and total angular momentum) locating the innermost stable circular orbit ({ISCO}) is found in Newtonian gravity for some value of the adiabatic index gamma\_0, that of the {ADM} mass (and total angular momentum) should exist in the {IWM} approximation of general relativity for the same value of the adiabatic index.},

The {GRMHD} extension of the Toolkit builds upon previous releases and implements the evolution of relativistic magnetised fluids in the ideal {MHD} limit in fully dynamical spacetimes using the same shock-capturing techniques previously applied to hydrodynamical evolution. In order to maintain the divergence-free character of the magnetic field, the code implements both hyperbolic divergence cleaning and constrained transport schemes. We present test results for a number of {MHD} tests in Minkowski and curved spacetimes. Minkowski tests include aligned and oblique planar shocks, cylindrical explosions, magnetic rotors, Alfv{\textbackslash}'en waves and advected loops, as well as a set of tests designed to study the response of the divergence cleaning scheme to numerically generated monopoles. We study the code's performance in curved spacetimes with spherical accretion onto a black hole on a fixed background spacetime and in fully dynamical spacetimes by evolutions of a magnetised polytropic neutron star and of the collapse of a magnetised stellar core. Our results agree well with exact solutions where these are available and we demonstrate convergence. All code and input files used to generate the results are available on http://einsteintoolkit.org.

	abstract = {With the first two detections in late 2015, astrophysics has officially entered into the new era of gravitational wave observations. Since then, much has been going on in the field with a lot of work focussing on the observations and implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity in the strong regime. However much less is understood about how gravitational detectors really work at their fundamental level. For decades, the response to incoming signals has been customarily calculated using the very same physical principle, which has proved so successful in the first detections. In this paper we review the physical principle that is behind such a detection at the very fundamental level, and we try to highlight the peculiar subtleties that make it so hard in practice. We will then mention how detectors are built starting from this fundamental measurement element.},

The Einstein Toolkit is currently based on the Cactus Framework for high-performance computing and the Carpet adaptive mesh refinement driver. It implements spacetime evolution via the {BSSN} evolution system and general-relativistic hydrodynamics in a finite-volume discretization. The toolkit is under continuous development and contains many new code components that have been publicly released for the first time and are described in this article. We discuss the motivation behind the release of the toolkit, the philosophy underlying its development, and the goals of the project. A summary of the implemented numerical techniques is included, as are results of numerical test covering a variety of sample astrophysical problems.},

These conditions are equality of {ADM} and Komar mass at infinity and equality of the {ADM} and a rescaled Komar mass at each puncture. In this paper we explicitly give results for the case of an equal mass black hole binary without spin, but our approach can also be applied in the general case. We find that up to numerical accuracy the apparent horizon mass also remains constant along the sequence and that the prediction for the innermost stable circular orbit is similar to what has been found with the effective potential method.},

	abstract = {Gravitational waves are propagating ﬂuctuations of gravitational ﬁelds, that is, ”ripples” in spacetime, generated mainly by moving massive bodies. These distortions of spacetime travel with the speed of light. Every body in the path of such a wave feels a tidal gravitational force that acts perpendicular to the waves direction of propagation; these forces change the distance between points, and the size of the changes is proportional to the distance between the points. Gravitational waves can be detected by devices which measure the induced length changes. The frequencies and the amplitudes of the waves are related to the motion of the masses involved. Thus, the analysis of gravitational waveforms allows us to learn about their source and, if there are more than two detectors involved in observation, to estimate the distance and position of their source on the sky.},

	abstract = {In this work we analyze the gravitational wave signal from hypermassive neutron stars formed after the merger of binary neutron star systems, focusing on its spectral features. The gravitational wave signals are extracted from numerical relativity simulations of models already considered by De Pietri et al. [Phys. Rev. D 93, 064047 (2016)], Maione et al. [Classical Quantum Gravity 33, 175009 (2016)], and Feo et al. [Classical Quantum Gravity 34, 034001 (2017)], and allow us to study the effect of the total baryonic mass of such systems (from \$2.4 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ to \$3 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), the mass ratio (up to \$q = 0.77\$), and the neutron star equation of state, both in equal and highly unequal mass binaries. We use the peaks we find in the gravitational spectrum as an independent test of already published hypotheses of their physical origin and empirical relations linking them with the characteristics of the merging neutron stars. In particular, we highlight the effects of the mass ratio, which in the past was often neglected. We also analyze the temporal evolution of the emission frequencies. Finally, we introduce a modern variant of Prony's method to analyze the gravitational wave postmerger emission as a sum of complex exponentials, trying to overcome some drawbacks of both Fourier spectra and least-squares fitting. Overall, the spectral properties of the postmerger signal observed in our simulation are in agreement with those proposed by other groups. More specifically, we find that the analysis of Bauswein and Stergioulas [Phys. Rev. D 91, 124056 (2015)] is particularly effective for binaries with very low masses or with a small mass ratio and that the mechanical toy model of Takami et al. [Phys. Rev. D 91, 064001 (2015)] provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the early stages of the postmerger.},

	abstract = {We present results from three-dimensional general relativistic simulations of binary neutron star coalescences and mergers using public codes. We considered equal mass models where the baryon mass of the two Neutron Stars ({NS}) is \$1.4M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, described by four different equations of state ({EOS}) for the cold nuclear matter ({APR}4, {SLy}, H4, and {MS}1; all parametrized as piecewise polytropes). We started the simulations from four different initial interbinary distances (\$40, 44.3, 50\$, and \$60\$ km), including up to the last 16 orbits before merger. That allows to show the effects on the gravitational wave phase evolution, radiated energy and angular momentum due to: the use of different {EOSs}, the orbital eccentricity present in the initial data and the initial separation (in the simulation) between the two stars. Our results show that eccentricity has a major role in the discrepancy between numerical and analytical waveforms until the very last few orbits, where "tidal" effects and missing high-order post-Newtonian coefficients also play a significant role. We test different methods for extrapolating the gravitational wave signal extracted at finite radii to null infinity. We show that an effective procedure for integrating the Newman-Penrose \${\textbackslash}psi\_4\$ signal to obtain the gravitational wave strain \$h\$ is to apply a simple high-pass digital filter to \$h\$ after a time domain integration, where only the two physical motivated integration constants are introduced. That should be preferred to the more common procedures of introducing additional integration constants, integrating in the frequency domain or filtering \${\textbackslash}psi\_4\$ before integration.},

	abstract = {We give an introduction to the Einstein Toolkit, a mature, open-source computational infrastructure for numerical relativity based on the Cactus Framework, for the target group of new users. This toolkit is composed of several different modules, is developed by researchers from different institutions throughout the world and is in active continuous development. Documentation for the toolkit and its several modules is often scattered across different locations, a difficulty new users may at times have to struggle with. Scientific papers exist describing the toolkit and its methods in detail, but they might be overwhelming at first. With these lecture notes we hope to provide an initial overview for new users. We cover how to obtain, compile and run the toolkit, and give an overview of some of the tools and modules provided with it.},
